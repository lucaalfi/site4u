## Getting Started:
We are currently using Node for package management. 
So after clonning the repo you must run:`npm install`

**Note:**
  - This should get all of the dependencies done which will become increasingly important as we get to back end development.
  - Any issues with the packaged and dependencies will be displayed here and need to be addressed.

After running the install command you should be able to run it with: `npm run dev` 

Node should display in which port of the local host the program is running at and you should be able to access it from any browser in that machine.
